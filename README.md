Number 1 Olin team at MakeMIT

The project: to design and build a sub-$100 facial recognition device using a Raspberry Pi. The RasPi takes video, and determines whether or not a face is in the frame. If one is, the Pi forwards that frame on to our server, which does more heavy lifting computer vision to determine whose face it is. Once the face is identified, the server posts that photo to a webpage for the end user to browse.

Still very much a work in progress.
